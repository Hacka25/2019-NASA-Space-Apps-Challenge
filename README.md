You've provided the relevant source files for a React project:

**package.json**: This file contains metadata about your project, including its name, version, dependencies, and scripts.

**package-lock.json**: This file is automatically generated by npm when you install packages. It keeps track of the exact versions of all packages that are installed in your project.

From these files, I can see that:

1. Your project is a React application with several dependencies, including `@inlet/react-pixi`, `pixi.js`, `react-spring`, and `react-three-fiber`.
2. You're using `react-scripts` to manage your build process.
3. You have scripts defined for starting the development server (`start`), building the application (`build`), testing the application (`test`), and ejecting the project (`eject`).
4. Your ESLint configuration extends the default React app configuration.

If you're experiencing issues with your project, feel free to ask specific questions or provide more context about what's not working as expected!
